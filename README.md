# A Comparative Analysis of Population Annealing and Quantum Annealing solving Unit Commitment problem

Unit Commitment is one of the fundamental mathematical optimization problems in electrical power management, which considers the coordination of power generation from a set of units to meet a target quantity of power. 
Many variants of the UC problem, which represents various real-life scenarios. 
UCP aims to minimize the total costs of power generation. 
That's why researchers are always driven to find effective methods to solve it. 
In this work, we compare between Population Annealing classical optimizing method and Quantum annealing optimization to solve the UCP in time needed to get a solution, studying the effect of four possible factors on the performance of the solvers. Overall, we see that population annealing is an effective method better than quantum annealing, but  we still expect that quantum annealing should outperform the classical methods in the future.
